Data Visualization on Zomato Dataset 
Hi Welcome to my First Data Visualization Project , it based on Zomato Dataset.

Where i have created 2 dashboards.

The first one shows insights on overall locations and the second one is a filtered based where on selection of particular location it derives various insights
such as average cost, number of restuarants, types of restuarants and dishes liked.

U can find the original dataset at -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants

And the transformed csv can be fount in my github repo.
Thanks
